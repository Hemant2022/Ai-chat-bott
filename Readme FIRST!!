Hello ,

Thank You for reviewing my project .In this project i have Created a Dashboard Web site using HTML and connected it with 
a couple of APIs. Here are some details: 

I was not able to get the twilio original number though i have coded as it was a True number and it can be checked by putting
a Paid Twilio Account credentials. Front End may not be neat , but everthing works as specified .

Steps:

a) User registers First

b) logs in 

c) sends sms 

1) Templates folder has templates that are linked with flask .

2) App.py is the main file .

3) Message sent is a picture that shows the message sent as queued because i have a trial account , Moreover it shows the message body whos credentials i have requested from the dashboard successfully.

4) Sentiment verification shows the working of the sentiment part successfully.

5) Score print shows the score that was generated using the Microsoft Api.

6) Dash gives a view of the dashboard.
